# Duplicate Entry

## Installation

1. Download and upload the 'duplicate_entry' folder to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable the extension by selecting "Duplicate Entry" in the list and choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

## Usage

When viewing an entry's "edit" form you will see a "Save as New" button. Submitting the form using this button will save changes to a brand new entry. If you have two sections with identical schemas (field names and types are compared) then a dropdown will be displayed beside the Save as New button allowing you to save a copy of the entry into the other section.

## Todo
* Fix bug whereby validation errors render the form back in "new" mode (potentially unfixable)
